## Routing Requests

### General information:

First, we created  a handler function for the GET requests that will be received. Now that we have a simple handler function, we can invoke it when GET requests are received. Next, we passed the req and res variables from the .createServer() callback into the handler function as the first and second arguments, respectively.
